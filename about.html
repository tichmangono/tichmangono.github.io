## About this Blog

I use this space to share what I learn about Python and Machine Learning.


## About me

I care about improving global public health and I love using Python and R to solve analytic problems.

Currently, I apply analytics to develop strategies for HIV prevention and advise ministries of health on
high-impact public health decisions across southern Africa.

Join me as I share my discoveries on this blog!
